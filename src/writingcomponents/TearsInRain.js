            <h2>[Postmortem]</h2>
            <p>This story was made last year for my fiction writing class, and takes heavy inspiration from a little bit of blade runner and some other things that I can’t remember rn. Also had an assignment to create an alternate ending, so that’s the one I’ll be posting because I think it’s better. If anyone wants the other one slide into my DMs.</p>
