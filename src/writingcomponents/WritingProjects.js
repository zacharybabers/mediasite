Earth, its surface dried and cracked from decades of drought, was once again made to cry; the drizzle that began as a small test of Terra I, the terraforming machine intended to bring humanity beyond Earth, swiftly snowballed in intensity, developing into an unending torrent. As days of storm turned into weeks, months, and years, a flood unlike any other ravaged the planet. In a final, desperate effort to preserve their way of life, a new technological renaissance known as the Last Flourish began; mankind searched for a way to survive the endless downpour. Along with numerous other technological advancements, so too came the floating cities: humanity’s last ark on Earth’s now endless and ever deepening ocean.
