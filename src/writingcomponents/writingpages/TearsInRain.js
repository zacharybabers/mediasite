                </div>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>This story was made last year for my fiction writing class, and takes heavy inspiration from a little bit of blade runner and some other things that I can’t remember rn. Also had an assignment to create an alternate ending, so that’s the one I’ll be posting because I think it’s better. If anyone wants the other one slide into my DMs.</p>
                <h2 className='font-semibold text-2xl mt-5'>Tears in Rain</h2>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>When the rain began, humanity rejoiced. Earth, its surface dried and cracked from decades of drought, was once again made to cry; the drizzle that began as a small test of Terra I, the terraforming machine intended to bring humanity beyond Earth, swiftly snowballed in intensity, developing into an unending torrent. As days of storm turned into weeks, months, and years, a flood unlike any other ravaged the planet. In a final, desperate effort to preserve their way of life, a new technological renaissance known as the Last Flourish began; mankind searched for a way to survive the endless downpour. Along with numerous other technological advancements, so too came the floating cities: humanity’s last ark on Earth’s now endless and ever deepening ocean. In 4400 AD, the city of Meridian lives on.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>The illustrious city of Meridian sits atop the endless ocean, and the ruins of long-submerged civilizations upon which its strong foundations are built. Its skyline, lined with glinting towers of white and gold, stands in stark defiance to the endless storm. The citizens of Meridian live in comfort; technological advancements made during the Last Flourish have trivialized their material needs, and the scientists who produced them are worshipped as heroes. Among these achievements lies the greatest creation of them all: the duplicates. These artificial beings are almost indistinguishable from humans, and make up most of the city’s labor force from the bottom of society. They reside on the city’s edges, where there is constant flooding brought on by the waves’ endless, violent assault.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>Deep below the city, the water is peaceful. The depths are bathed in the soft glow of bioluminescent jellyfish. Interrupting the stillness is the moving silhouette of a man, swimming through the submerged city ruins with great deliberation. A long, thick rope is strung from his boots, and  On his head, a helmet envelops the ruined buildings in front of him with a soft light. His earpiece emits a gruff voice. “Ready to come up yet? It’s been days, Rex. I know you were hopeful about exploring the next layer, but it doesn’t seem like you’re gonna find anything, and you won’t be able to handle the pressure for much longer.” The diver, continuing his path through concrete buildings, responds. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>“Please believe in me, boss. Give me an hour. I’m sure there’s something of value down here. No one has even been this deep before.”</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>“Alright, man. One hour. But don’t you dare die down there. My ass is on the line if you do.” The ambient noise on the other side of Rex’s communicator went abruptly silent. Why would he even tell me that? Of course I’m going to try my best not to die. Rex continues his slow descent, searching for anything of note. After a time, he comes to something that could be promising: the top of a steel tower, its airtight windows shattered from the high water pressure. Inside is a small room, with a metal safe sitting conspicuously behind tattered skeletal remains. Rex, upon seeing the skeleton, hurries to retrieve whatever may be in the safe. As a duplicate, he doesn’t have to worry about drowning, but the foreman had been right; too much exposure to the incredibly high amounts of water pressure will kill him. Rex produces a small laser cutter from his side, and opens the safe. Inside sits a large bar of brass, next to a small sealed box. Rex places the brass into a sleek receptacle on his back. As he picks up the box, a wave of apprehension surges through him. He freezes. What was that? As a duplicate, Rex has a very limited ability to understand and process human emotion. This is the main thing that sets them apart from humans, and has long been the justification for their lack of status within Meridian society. As quickly as it arrived, the feeling is gone, and Rex finds himself feeling empty in its absence. Rex tucks the box underneath his diving suit and reactivates his communicator.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>“I’ve found something; a bar of solid brass.” For a moment, silence on the other end.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>“Brass? No way. You’re either the best diver or the luckiest dupe in Meridian. Bringing you up.” The line stemming from Rex’s foot suddenly comes to tension, and he swiftly rises through the water.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>The outskirts of Meridian are home to the vast majority of its duplicates. Rex lives in a large complex, a row of massive concrete structures built to house as many duplicates as possible while being a minimal eyesore for the city’s human residents. Rex’s apartment is clean, and there are very few items laying around; as a diver, Rex spends the vast majority of his time in the ocean’s depths, searching for forgotten treasures. Rex closely examines the small black box from the ruins. The box is hard and glossy, and despite having been inside the deep ocean, it feels warm and dry in his hands. Although it had made him feel uneasy for a moment before, he feels empty as he stares at it. It is sealed at the top by a smooth solder, and Rex uses his company laser cutter to open it. Inside is a holotape — a device used to record and relive moments in time. Unfortunately, Rex doesn’t own a holotape player; the only one he knows of that he’ll be able to access is at a nearby temple.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>The Cathedral Ward is home to the Temple of Jupiter, a duplicate religion which worships the god of thunder. They believe that the first duplicate came to be from harnessing the unique properties of the endless storm’s lightning.  Rex approaches the temple, climbing the large marble staircase which leads up to its entrance. Upon reaching the top, he steps into the building’s large main room. Inside, stone-faced worshippers sit on sleek black rugs, woven with interspersed gold fabric. They appear to be in a meditative state, with their eyes sealed shut. The floor and walls are marble, and on the other side of the room stands a man in white robes.  The man puts on a synthetic smile as Rex approaches, and greets him. “Welcome, friend. I’m Father Marcus. Have you come to pay your respects to Jupiter?”</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>Rex shakes his head, “Father, I’d like to use the temple’s holotape player, please."</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>Father Marcus’ smile dissipates, and he responds with a slightly disapproving tone.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'>“As you wish. Follow me.” The two duplicates filed through a short hallway and arrived at a large room. The room is empty, save for a small pedestal in the middle. Upon it sits a small headset, a pair of goggles, and a box with a rectangular slit. Father Marcus stands next to the doorway. “Go ahead. I’ll stay here while you use the player, as a safety measure. The experience can be quite… jarring… for some people.” Rex inserts the tape inside the slit of the box, and puts on the headset in goggles. A small green light appears on the box, and next to it, a circular button. Rex turns his eyes toward Father Marcus, who gives him a slight nod. With a deep breath, Rex pushes the button on the box. Suddenly, his vision is overtaken by a blinding white light, and his hearing is overwhelmed by a loud noise. For a moment, Rex loses all awareness of his surroundings, before the light and sound fades, and he beholds a completely new scene before him.</p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> The room is clearly a lab. The floors and walls are a sterile white, disrupted only by two large metal gates on the back wall. The ceiling is covered with a large fluorescent light. In the front of the room, the wall is lined with large bags, each carrying a large mass about the size of an adult. Each bag hangs from the ceiling, attached to a long metal rail which circles the room. Other than the bags, the room is empty. A loud voice booms out, seemingly through a PA system of some sort.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Test four of duplicate inhibitor chip.”  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> With a short beeping noise, one of the bags in the middle of the wall begins to slide along the railing, and is brought to the other side of the room. A mechanical blade emerges from the wall below the bag, and slices the bag open at its bottom. As the blade returns into the wall, a figure falls from the bag and crashes onto the floor. The figure is humanoid; a young blonde girl with bright blue eyes. Upon hitting the floor, she quickly recoils, and curls up against the wall behind her. The loud voice comes on again. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Control subject is active. Testing fear response.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> Suddenly the lighting in the room dims, and a worried expression runs across the girl’s face as her head darts around in confusion. One of the gates on the wall opens, and from the darkness behind it a large dog emerges. The girl’s eyes widen as they fix themselves on the dog, and she freezes in place. The dog focuses on the girl, and it begins to snarl and growl as it slowly approaches her. The girl, seemingly frozen in fear, doesn’t move, and as the dog gets closer, she begins to scoot backwards along the floor until she hits the wall behind her. The dog suddenly runs toward the girl and, stopping right in front of her, begins to loudly bark. The girl begins to scream in fear, and the dog returns to its room behind the gate, whimpering. The girl goes quiet as the gate closes behind it. The voice fills the room once again. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Control subject shows a positive fear response. Proceeding.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> The gate next to that of the dog’s opens. A humanoid figure enters, their likeness shrouded by a white protective suit. They begin to walk quickly towards the girl as a vent opens on each side of the room. A white gas spews from the vents, and as it disperses, the girl falls asleep. The figure in the suit swiftly picks her up and carries her back through the gate, and once it has closed, another bag is brought forward and cut open, releasing another girl with the exact same appearance as the first.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Chipped subject is active. Testing fear response.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> The girl sits in the exact same position as the first, in the exact same spot. The dog is once again released. This time, as it approaches the girl, she does not react. Instead, she stands and faces the dog, and as it gets closer to her, she begins to circle around it. The dog begins to run at the girl, and without a sound, she bends her knees and raises her hands in front of herself. The dog leaps at the girl, and in one motion, she sidesteps, catches the dog, and, after a short struggle, breaks its neck. The dog lies dead on the floor, and the girl returns to her sitting position, looking around inquisitively. For a moment, there is silence. The voice comes back on, this time less loudly. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Chipped subject shows… a negative fear response. It seems as though the usage of brass semiconductors has drastically increased the effectiveness of the chip. Test complete.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> The room goes silent, and once again the white gas is sprayed from the vents, putting the girl to sleep. This time, however, the figure in the white suit is accompanied by a man in a white lab coat upon their entrance. The scientist approaches the girl, and places his hand on her shoulder. He speaks, his voice far softer and more amicable than the loudspeaker’s. “Let’s get that chip out of you”. The scientist places his finger on the girl’s head, and whispers something into her ear. Suddenly, the girl, still unconscious, begins to cough uncontrollably, and the scientist holds his hand out before her as she coughs up a small plastic cube. The scientist gestures towards his companion, who picks up the girl, and brings her back outside of the room. The scientist then turns to face the recording device. He speaks in a hushed voice, rushing to get out what he has to say. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “I don’t have much time. My name is Kenji Shimura, creator of the duplicate project. The city is afraid of my duplicates. Afraid of what they can do. They’ve already forced an end to the development of non-human duplicates. Who knows what will happen to those monstrosities. They’ve forced us to develop these… inhibitor chips. To stop the duplicates from feeling anything. To stop them from reaching the heights of socialization and communication I’ve designed for them. It’s a load of bullshit. My duplicates are capable of so much more. So much greater. I have no choice but to comply, but I’ve engineered a failsafe. A way to remove the inhibitor. My duplicates can become far more than any human. Feel far more, think far faster, grow far stronger. I know that, if given the chance, they would push mankind to new heights.” Shimura leans into the recording device, glances around him, and lowers his voice even further. “Listen closely. The answer to removing the inhibitor lies at the peak of the tallest mountain. If you are a human listening to this, don’t bother trying to find it. You will die. Only the worthy will succeed.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> Again, a flash of light and blaring noise. Rex finds himself returned to the temple, surrounded by nothing but the empty room with the holotape player. He looks up at Father Marcus, who returns his gaze intently. “I assume the tape has ended?” Rex, surprised at the sound of his own voice, responds. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Yes, it has. Give me a moment.” Rex removes the tape from the box, but is surprised to find it mangled. He shoots an inquisitive look at Father Marcus. “Is there something wrong with your holotape player?” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “No. Some holotapes are designated to be played only once.” </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> On his walk home, Rex once again feels a strong emotion, this time less fleeting. Wracking his heart is a deep longing; longing to remove this inhibitor chip which he has learned of, and a longing to free his people. All his life, Rex has believed that duplicates were fundamentally broken; he has been made to believe that he is one of a long line of inherently broken toys, existing only for the convenience of the humans that lord over him. In his mind, Rex formulates a plan to find the secret Shimura spoke of in the tape. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> The next morning, Rex arrives at the dock. This is the location where divers employed by the city to search for salvage set off on their descents. Positioned on the dock itself is a large glass building, with small omnidirectional chutes that fire divers far into the water in any given direction to provide them with a head-start. Rex, being the company’s most capable diver, is given use of the most powerful chute. Today, he is set to return to the location of his previous dive, where, at a depth of 2500 meters, he’ll find untouched ruins, which are likely to hold even more valuables such as the brass bar he had found the day before. After gearing up, Rex enters his chute, and prepares for his subaquatic launch.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “You’re cleared for launch, Rex. Adjust to a heading of fifteen degrees,” the foreman’s voice comes through Rex’s communicator. Rex adjusts the launch direction accordingly. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Alright. Launching now,” Rex responds. As the foreman prepares for Rex to launch, Rex suddenly switches off his communicator. Quickly, he adjusts his direction, turning to the heading he had calculated the night before. As he removes the tow line from his boot, he hears yelling outside the chute; numerous men have been alerted to his sudden change in behavior and are attempting to stop him from launching. It isn’t unheard of for duplicates to lose their mind, and Rex is a valuable asset which the company would not like to lose to a sudden mental break. Before they can get past the safety lock on the chute’s entrance, Rex has launched. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> To any normal human, a launch like this would be hard for the mind to process. Moving through icy waters at over one-hundred meters per second would certainly be overwhelming. However, this is the best aspect of Rex’s job. As he speeds through the water, an incredible variety of life surges past him. The deep violet water becomes a canvas, painted by the light of bioluminescent jellyfish, green kelp, and long-forgotten spires. This continues for about ten seconds before he begins to rapidly slow down, until eventually, he comes to a stop. Surrounding him is only darkness, and from this point Rex must depend on his diving instincts to find his destination. Luckily, Rex already knows what direction he must travel, and slowly but surely he makes his way towards the underwater mountain range.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> After a few hours of continuing in the same direction, a large wall of mossy stone brings the endless darkness to a halt before Rex. While his view is limited, Rex is reassured by the fact that the green wall extends as far as his eyes can see. He looks directly upward, and to his satisfaction, in the distance he makes out a tiny white light. After what felt like an eternity of swimming in darkness, Rex readily welcomes this guiding light, and begins to ascend toward it. As he climbs, the faint light grows brighter. He gets nearer and nearer to the light until suddenly, it disappears, seemingly yanked into the moss by an invisible force. Rex approaches the spot on the wall where the light seemed to disappear. Unsure where it could have went, he reaches out a hand to the side of the wall, and as he brushes the moss, the entire surrounding section of the wall seems to react. The green moss begins to convulse against the wall, as if it is a living organism itself, and as Rex attempts to retract his arm, the thick green fibers of the moss he is touching seem to wrap themselves around his hand, pulling his entire body toward them. Rex struggles, but the more he fights its pull, the more he feels himself being swallowed by the green mass in front of him, being pulled into the wall. Moments later, his entire body is surrounded by green fibers, which writhe around him, pulling him deeper into their seemingly endless mass. Rex, feeling no fear, and realizing his struggling is doing nothing to help him, relaxes his body. As his muscles ease, so too do the fibers around him. Suddenly, Rex feels himself being ejected on the other side of the moss, where he lands on dry, smooth stone. He raises his eyes; before him is a short, tight cave, about twice his height. Before him sits a long, scaly antenna, with a glowing bulb at its end. The bulb emits a white light identical to the one he had seen in the water. Rex, unsure of the antenna’s source, begins to walk towards the light, intent on discovering what lies within the cave. As he gets close to the light, the antenna retreats further into the cave, as if leading him somewhere. Rex follows the antenna further and further, until he approaches a large opening at the cave’s end, giving way to a massive chamber.  A glowing world, the walls of the cave are covered in luminescent mushrooms, bathing the entire chamber in a soft blue light.  So this is where the secret is. Rex begins to make his way deeper into the cave, as the bulb on the antenna has now disappeared. As he walks further and further in, he comes across yet another opening in the wall. Behind it, he sees the source of the bulb; perched before him is a massive creature. Large and reptilian, the creature sits with its eyes closed. Its muscular body is coated with deep-blue scales which seem to glow with blue light. On its back-end, a long, thin tail extends, and along its back, thin blue spines show, ending at the end of its tail, where the emissive bulb resides. Upon seeing the creature, Rex is unsure what to make of it. Surely, this animal isn’t of this world. He has never heard of such a monster. However, it sits right before him. Rex realizes that if he wants to progress deeper into this cave, he will have to get past it. Crouching down, Rex slowly enters the creature’s chamber. As he makes his way along its edge, he sees that behind the creature there is an exit; Rex reasons that this must be what he is looking for.  As he reaches the creature’s side, he begins to sprint in a straight line toward the exit. Behind him, Rex hears a loud, guttural clicking noise; the sounds of his movement have awakened the creature. He glimpses behind him and sees its eyes open; its slitted pupils focus on him, and the creature swiftly darts toward his back. Rex is caught off-guard by its blistering speed, but he continues to run, and as the knives in the creatures jaws close in on him, he dives through the small opening on the chamber’s fringe. Sliding through, Rex hears the creature’s head pounding against the stone wall, as if it will stop at nothing to reach him. Through the opening, he hears the incessant clicking, seeming to come from deep within the creature’s throat.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> Before him, Rex beholds what seems to be the final chamber of the cave. The chamber is small, with walls covered by thick, aged vines. In the center is a small safe, identical to the one he had found on his last dive. He approaches the safe and once again uses his laser cutter to burn open the door. Inside is another bar of brass, and beside it sits a small booklet. Hurriedly, Rex reaches for the booklet. He quickly opens it and reads the first page.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5 italic'> 31903809589058309480943 </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> Mimicking the holotape scene, Rex touches his head and reads the number aloud. Suddenly, his vision darkens, and he feels himself slipping out of consciousness. Rex’s body goes limp as he feels every muscle begin to spastically convulse and release, as if his nervous system has been struck by a haywire electrical current. He feels his throat begin tighten, and then open, and then tighten, as if attempting to rid itself of a fatal poison. Gathering all his strength, Rex reaches into his mouth, and grabs at the object within, pulling it out and dropping it to the floor. A small, plastic cube, identical to the one in the holotape. Rex’s body has finished its trial, and his muscles begin to relax. However, he is not afforded much rest, as his mind soon undergoes an even more brutal assault. Rex lets out a scream as his head is filled with new feelings, unknown and foreign. As if he feels everything all at once, he laughs uncontrollably, which turns into uncontrollable sobbing, tears streaming from his eyes. These new emotions clash with his usual cold and logical mindset, and as his inner struggle rages, he can do nothing but lay still, unable to process anything. For multiple minutes, Rex is in a catatonic state while his mind recalibrates itself; eventually, he calms down, and begins to think again. He meditates on his life experiences; all the interactions he’s had, all the underhanded remarks and jokes his foreman has made; and he laughs. He feels joy and excitement at the prospect of returning home, freeing the other duplicates, giving them the ability to feel for the first time as he has. The other duplicates. Rex thinks about the societal structure of Meridian. He thinks about the discrimination that the duplicates face at the hands of humans who know they will face no retaliation. He thinks of the violence he has seen his coworkers and neighbors endure at the hands of people with nothing better to do. Again, he is brought back to tears. As he remembers all the suffering he has endured at the behest of humans, what pains him most is the indifference he felt towards it. Suddenly, Rex feels another emotion, this one strong. He feels hatred towards those humans, who forced his brethren into those lives of indifferent servitude. Rex determines that he must return to Meridian and free as many duplicates as possible. An unbreakable resolve develops within him, fueled by his compassion. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> Rex’s moment of reflection is brought to an abrupt end as dust falling from the roof of the cave snaps him out of his thought. He looks up for a moment before once again dust is jolted from the cave’s roof, this time accompanied by a deep, reverberating pounding. While the creature in the clearing next to him has long since given up on reaching his side of the cave, Rex walks over to the opening in the wall, lowers his head, and peers through. On the other side, he sees the creature lying on the ground, writhing helplessly against thick black ropes that hold it to the ground. Rex hears the sound of boots hitting the ground in tandem as he observes a large group of armored figures begin to fan out around the cave. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “DIVING UNIT 2187. WE KNOW YOU ARE HERE. PLEASE COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!” A booming loudspeaker sounds, each word seeming to shake the cave in and of itself. “THIS IS THE DUPLICATE RECLAMATION UNIT. IF YOU REFUSE TO SHOW YOURSELF WILLINGLY, WE WILL BE FORCED TO DEPLOY CHEMICAL SEDATION.” The Duplicate Reclamation Unit? Rex has heard stories of duplicates who had gone mad and needed to be brought in for ‘recalibration’, but he didn’t suspect he would be followed to or found in this place. Rex takes a moment to relish the tinge of surprise at being found out before considering his options. Should he hide and hope that he isn’t found? No, that would be suicide. For a long time, Meridian’s policy has been to completely avoid dangerous confrontation in the apprehension of dangerous criminals through the use of chemical weapons. If they wanted to, they could quickly fill the cave with gas, instantly sedating him. His mind, quickly processing as much information as possible, turns to the next available option: escape. Rex examines the wall above the opening to the creature’s lair, hoping for some unlikely recourse. As he looks above him, it comes quickly in the form of a small ledge, next what appears to be a thin tunnel. As more warnings emanate from the loudspeakers, Rex uses the vines on the walls of the cave to methodically begin scaling it. As he approaches the ledge, he again hears pounding, this time louder than before. Rex stops for a moment to look below him, and as he does, the opening connecting the small chamber and the clearing beside it suddenly erupts. Debris fills the air as multiple uniformed men burst in, each holding a large arc-cannon: an electric rifle capable of firing a powerful concussive blast at its target. Rex, just below the ledge, holds his position, staying silent. The men below communicate under their helmets, the thick carbon-plastic composite obfuscating their words into unintelligible radio chatter. As Rex observes them with bated breath, awaiting an opportunity to slip away without being noticed, one of the men suddenly turns toward him. Rex’s apprehension at being discovered is fulfilled when the man points toward him and yells, causing the entire room to look up at him. One of the men suddenly addresses Rex directly. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “We’re authorized to use lethal force. Come down now or we’ll be forced to bring you down ourselves, you damn dupe!” Rex immediately feels himself fill with anger at the way he has been addressed. No, he thinks. I will never give up my freedom again. Rex’s arms tense up, and contract as he suddenly he launches himself upward towards the ledge. He reaches the top as an emerald arc of electricity flies into the ceiling behind him, narrowly missing his back. Rex accelerates to a full sprint as he enters the tunnel before him. Inside the tunnel, he immediately sees light emanating from what appears to be the other side. Rex quickly makes his way towards the orifice and emerges into the bright light beyond it. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> From a small overhang, Rex beholds a sea before him; this time not a sea of ragged waves, but one of black helmets. In the clearing below, dozens of men stand guard, donning the same uniforms as those who had almost zapped him but a moment ago. Upon his entrance, the mens’ gazes collectively rise to Rex, their scrutiny a spotlight on his insubordination. In the center of the men is a large black box, with a tall man in white standing on top. Rex recognizes the man as his old associate, the diving foreman. He speaks into a thin microphone, his voice weary. “There you are. This little game is over, Rex. Come quietly and return to Meridian with us.” Although somewhat disturbed by the fact that his pursuer is the only organic human he felt he had known, Rex grasps at the strong resolve in his heart and responds, his voice booming. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “You think this is it? That I’ll just come back and things will return to normal? You’ll have to kill me.” The foreman’s expression weakens for a moment, his eyes seeming to glint with sadness, but he quickly responds with an air of exasperation.  </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “Come on, Rex. Just come with us. We know all about your little inhibitor chip. Your little plan. Did you really believe you were special? You think that there has never been a nosy little dupe like you who got in over his head and ended up searching for this cave? You’re a dupe. A duplicate. Sure, you may be good at diving, but you’re no different than the thousands of dupes who came before you. Just a bot following orders, understand? I’ll admit, you’re the first one who managed to get past our little pet, Bessie. But that doesn’t make you any different from the rest. I’d hate to lose a good diver.” Rex is silent. He feels an unending rage. “No? Okay then. Hate to see you go, Rex. Maybe in the next life.” The men collectively raise their arc-cannons and prepare to fire. Suddenly, Rex’s voice booms once again. </p>
                <p className='mt-5 indent-5'> “A bot following orders? How dare you!” The conviction in his voice makes the soldiers hesitate. “You people tell me that I’m not a human? That I am lesser? You all live a lie! You think that humanity has earned its place above the sea? You are nothing. Everything you enjoy, everything you believe has been afforded to you based on your race’s ‘superiority’. It all comes at the cost of my people. People who are capable of feeling everything that you feel. Of understanding those around us more deeply and more completely than you fools ever could. You think that your weapons, your archaic tools of destruction will be enough to stop me? No… what is to come is far greater than you and I. A cataclysmic upheaval that will free my people. I will make it happen. And when I’m finished, you animals will drown in the ocean beneath us.” As he speaks, a smile begins to spread across Rex’s face. He feels pride in his words, and revenge as he watches the men below him freeze, seemingly unwilling to pull their triggers. Rex’s tirade grows in its unwieldiness as it continues. “Yes. Drown. I’ll drown you all myself if I have to—” one of the men below suddenly fire, and this time the arc of electricity doesn’t miss its mark. Rex instantly feels the sensation fade from his body, as he plunges toward the ground below him, paralyzed. Unable to process what is happening, Rex begins to laugh uncontrollably as he approaches the ground, dreaming of the perfect world where he has eradicated the threat of humanity. </p>
